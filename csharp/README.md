# eviDense C# interface

The eviDense module is an ultra-compact 4-color UV/VIS optical absorption photometer which enables full Quality Control on liquid handlers. For more information please visit https://www.hseag.com/colibri-factsheet-and-contact.

This C# interface allows you to control your eviDense module. Measure sample DNA concentration, purity or just absorbance at 230nm, 260nm, 280nm and 340nm wavelengths.

A detailed description can be found at TBD.

## Demo Applications
1. EviDenseDemo - a sample program how to integrate the EviDense Module into a liquid handler.
2. EviDenseOD - a sample program which shows how to calculate the optical density of a sample.

## Installation
Include the *.cs files in the folder EviDense directly in your project or use the published NuGet package https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hseagcom.EviDense/ .
