# eviDense

The eviDense module is an ultra-compact 4-color UV/VIS optical absorption photometer which enables full Quality Control on liquid handlers. 
For more information see https://www.hseag.com/colibri-factsheet-and-contact. To control the eviDense module HSE AG provides software interfaces in C or C#.

## Measuring procedure in short
1. Pick up a tip with your liquid handler
2. Aspirate at least 10 &#956;l of sample
3. Pick up a cuvette
4. Move the cuvette over the eviDense module
5. Prepare the eviDense Module with a baseline measurement
6. Insert the cuvette into the eviDense module
7. Measure the empty cuvette
8. Dispense approximately 10.0 &#956;l sample into the cuvette
9. Measure the cuvette with sample
10. Calculate the concentration of the sample
11. Move the cuvette out off the eviDense module
12. Dispose the tip with attached cuvette
